# Evaluating the Influence of Different Meteorological Year Weather Files on District Energy Systems
A framework to perform multi-objective optimization of a district energy system, where the energy demands are simulated in EnergyPlus. We used the NSGA-II algorithm to optimize the sizing and operation planning of the district energy system considering variabilities in meteorological weather files.
